 Project Documentation for "Marter" – Basketball Court Scheduling Platform

               Introduction:
The **Marter** project is a web application designed to streamline the process of scheduling basketball games in community courts. By offering a simple, user-friendly interface, it allows local residents to easily book court times, view schedules, and access various community-related services.

Technical Details:

Technologies Used:
HTML5 & CSS3: The foundational technologies for creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
JavaScript: Implements interactive features such as the modal image viewer, login session management, and page redirection based on authentication status.
CSS Flexbox/Grid: Ensures a responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
  
Security and Session Management:
Local Storage: Used for maintaining the user session once they log in, making it easier for users to access their profiles and scheduled activities without having to log in repeatedly.
Secure Routing: Checks if a user is logged in before allowing access to certain pages. If a user tries to access the homepage without logging in, they are redirected to the sign-up page.

How It Works:
1. User Flow: The user starts on the sign-up page, enters their credentials, and is logged into the platform. Once logged in, they are redirected to the homepage where they can explore available basketball courts, check the schedule, and view gallery images.
2. Court Scheduling: The platform offers a list of courts and allows users to select the date and time for a match. The system then confirms availability.
3. Interactive Experience: Users can interact with the image gallery, click on any court image for more details, and view additional media content in modals.

User Interface Design:
Responsive Design: The platform is optimized for both mobile and desktop views, ensuring that users can access the service anytime, anywhere.
Modern UI: A sleek, clean design ensures that users can easily navigate through the site without distraction.

Conclusion:
The Marter platform is more than just a scheduling tool—it's an online community hub for basketball enthusiasts. By offering a seamless, interactive experience, users can easily manage court bookings, engage with local teams, and stay connected with community-driven events. Through careful integration of design, security, and interactivity, **Marter** aims to foster stronger communities around the sport of basketball while making scheduling and communication more efficient.
